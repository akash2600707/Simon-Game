Simon Game Challenge

This Git repository contains the source code for a Simon game created as part of Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development course. The Simon game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game where players need to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds presented by the game.

Project Overview:
The Simon game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

HTML (index.html):

Defines the structure of the webpage.
Includes a title, a level display, and four colored buttons (green, red, yellow, blue).
CSS (styles.css):

Styles the appearance of the game elements.
Uses Google Fonts for the "Press Start 2P" font, giving the game a retro aesthetic.
JavaScript (game.js):

Manages the game logic and functionality.
Generates and displays a random sequence of colors.
Listens for user input and checks if it matches the generated sequence.
Handles user interactions, button animations, and sound effects.
Tracks the game level and provides feedback for correct and incorrect moves.
How to Play:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Press any key to start the game.
Repeat the sequence of colors and sounds presented by the game by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
The game will progressively increase in difficulty as you successfully complete each level.
If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key.
